# Agent Protocol & Context

This file contains instructions and context for AI agents working on this repository.

## Future Roadmap

1. **Add More Units**: Expand the converter to support Volume, Area, and Time.
2. **Reverse Conversion**: Implement bidirectional conversion (e.g., ft -> m, lbs -> kg).
3. **Offline Mode & Persistence**: Save last used unit and values using `AsyncStorage`.

## Coding Standards

- Use functional components and Hooks.
- Ensure type safety with TypeScript.
- Write tests for all utility functions.
- Follow the 100-line logic rule where applicable.
